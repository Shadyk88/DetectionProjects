# DetectionProjects

This repository contains research on known tactics exploited by threat actors, as well as additional areas researched by yours truly, such as CVEs and niche attack methodologies. The objective is to provide proof-of-concept demonstrations of these attacks to enhance understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, the repository includes detection recommendations and hardening guidelines across various SIEM languages with which I am somewhat proficient in.
