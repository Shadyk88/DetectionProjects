# DetectionProjects

Repo contains research on known tactics abused by threat actors + other areas further researched by me(this could be CVEs, niche attacks etc etc.). The goal is to provide proofs of concept of the attacks to further understand the subject matter and provide detection recommendations (+ hardening recs) in a multitude of siem languages that I have experience in.
